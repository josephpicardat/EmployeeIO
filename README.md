# EmployeeIO

  ## Description

  What was my motivation?
  - To generate a database that is connected by three tables.

  Why did I build this project?
  - To learn how to apply mySQL to a real world scenario

  What problem does it solve?
  - It solves the problem of a normal spreadsheet, by getting rid of the task of scrolling to find the information needed and instead gives a simple UI that is easy to understand

  What did I learn?
  - I learned how to join three different tables as well as self-join one of them. Not only did I learn how to do that, I learned how to connect a user interface with the data stored by mysql.
